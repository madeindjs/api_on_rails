== Foreword

"API on Rails 5" is based on http://apionrails.icalialabs.com/book/["APIs on Rails: Building REST APIs with Rails"]. It was initially published in 2014 by https://twitter.com/kurenn[Abraham Kuri] under the licenses http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT[MIT] and http://people.freebsd.org/~phk/[Beerware].

Since the original work was not maintained, I wanted to update this excellent work and contribute to the Francophone community by translating it myself. This update is also available in the Molière language footnote:[It means french.].

== About the author

His experience includes working as a freelancer in software product development and more recently in collaboration within the open source community. A graduate in computer science from ITESM, he founded two companies in Mexico (http://icalialabs.com/[Icalia Labs] and http://codeandomexico.org/[Codeando Mexico]).

On my side, my name is http://rousseau-alexandre.fr[Alexandre Rousseau] and I am a Rails developer with more than 4 years of experience (at the time of writing). I am currently a partner in a company (https://isignif.fr[iSignif]) where I build and maintain a SAAS product using Rails. I also contribute to the Ruby community by producing and maintain some gems that you can consult onhttps://rubygems.org/profiles/madeindjs[my Rubygems.org profile]. Most of my projects are on GitHub so don’t http://github.com/madeindjs/[hesitate to follow me].

All the source code of this book is available in https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] format on https://github.com/madeindjs/api_on_rails[GitHub].
