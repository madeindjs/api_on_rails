[#chapter06-improve-json]
= Building JSON

In the previous chapter we added products to the application and built all the necessary routes. We have also associated a product with an user and restricted some of actions of `products_controller`.

Now you should be satisfied with all this work. But we still have a lot of work to do. Currently we have a JSON output that is not perfect. JSON output looks like this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "products": [
      {
          "id": 1,
          "title": "Tag Case",
          "price": "98.7761933800815",
          "published": false,
          "user_id": 1,
          "created_at": "2018-12-20T12:47:26.686Z",
          "updated_at": "2018-12-20T12:47:26.686Z"
      },
    ]
}
----

However we want an output that does not contain the fields `user_id`, `created_at` and `updated_at`.

An important (and difficult) part when creating your API is to decide the output format. Fortunately some organizations have already faced to this kind of problem and have established some conventions that you will discover in this chapter.

You can clone the project up to this point with:

[source,bash]
----
$ git checkout tags/checkpoint_chapter06
----

Let's start a new branch for this chapter:

[source,bash]
----
$ git checkout -b chapter06
----

== Presentation of https://jsonapi.org/[JSON:API]

An important and difficult part of creating your API is deciding the output format. Fortunately some conventions already exist. Certainly the most used of them  is https://jsonapi.org/[JSON:API].

The https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-structure[JSON:API documentation] gives us some rules to follow regarding the formatting of the JSON document.

Thus, our document *must* contain these keys:

* `data`: which must contain the data we send back
* `errors` which must contain an array of errors that have occurred
* `meta` which contains a https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-meta[meta object]

The content of the `data` key is also quite strict:

* it must have a `type` key corresponding of kind of the JSON model (an article, a user, etc...)
* properties of the objects must be placed in an `attributes` key
* links of the objects must be placed in a `relationships` key

In this chapter we will customize the JSON output using Netflix's gem: https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi[fast_jsonapi]. Luckily for use they already implements all https://jsonapi.org/[JSON:API] specifications.

So let's install the gem `fast_jsonapi`:

[source,bash]
----
$ bundle add fast_jsonapi
----

You should be ready to continue with this tutorial.

== Serialize user

FastJSON API uses *serializers*. Serializers represent Ruby classes that will be responsible to converting a model into an https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Hash.html[`Hash`] or a JSON.

So we need to add a `user_serializer.rb` file. We can do it manually but the gem provides a command line interface to do it:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate serializer User email
      create  app/serializers/user_serializer.rb
----

This has created a file called `user_serializer.rb` under the `app/serializers` directory. The new file should look like the following file:

[source,ruby]
.app/serializers/user_serializer.rb
----
class UserSerializer
  include FastJsonapi::ObjectSerializer
  attributes :email
end
----

This _serializer_ will allow us to convert our `User` object to JSON which implements all JSON:API specifications. Because we specified `email` as  `attributes` we retreive it in `data` array.

Let's try all this in the Rails with `rails console` console:

[source,ruby]
----
2.6.3 :001 > UserSerializer.new( User.first ).serializable_hash
=> {:data=>{:id=>"25", :type=>:user, :attributes=>{:email=>"tova@beatty.org"}}}
----

There you go. As you can see this is really easy. Now we can use our new _serializer_ in our _controller_:


.app/controllers/api/v1/users_controller.rb
[source,ruby]
----
class Api::V1::UsersController < ApplicationController
  # ...
  def show
    render json: UserSerializer.new(@user).serializable_hash
  end

  def update
    if @user.update(user_params)
      render json: UserSerializer.new(@user).serializable_hash
    else
      # ...
    end
  end

  def create
    # ...
    if @user.save
      render json: UserSerializer.new(@user).serializable_hash, status: :created
    else
      # ...
    end
  end

  # ...
end
----

Quite easy isn't it? However we should have a test who fails. Try it for yourself:

[source,bash]
----
$ rake test

Failure:
Expected: "one@one.org"
  Actual: nil
----

For some reason the answer is not quite what we expect. This is because the gem modifies the response we had previously defined. So to pass these tests you just have to modify it:

[source,ruby]
.test/controllers/api/v1/users_controller_test.rb
----
# ...
class Api::V1::UsersControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  # ...
  test "should show user" do
    # ...
    assert_equal @user.email, json_response['data']['attributes']['email']
  end
  # ...
end
----

If you do so test now should pass:

[source,bash]
----
$ rake test
........................
----

Let's commit these changes and keep moving forward:

[source,bash]
----
$ git add . && git commit -am "Adds user serializer for customizing the json output"
----


== Serialize products

Now that we understand how the serialization gem works it's time to customize the product output. The first step is the same as what we did in previous section. We need a product serializer. So let's do it:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate serializer Product title price published
      create  app/serializers/product_serializer.rb
----

Now let's add attributes to serialize the product:

[source,ruby]
.app/serializers/product_serializer.rb
----
class ProductSerializer
  include FastJsonapi::ObjectSerializer
  attributes :title, :price, :published
end
----

There you go. It's no more complicated than that. Let's change our controller a little bit.

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/api/v1/products_controller.rb
----
class Api::V1::ProductsController < ApplicationController
  # ...
  def index
    @products = Product.all
    render json: ProductSerializer.new(@products).serializable_hash
  end

  def show
    render json: ProductSerializer.new(@product).serializable_hash
  end

  def create
    product = current_user.products.build(product_params)
    if product.save
      render json: ProductSerializer.new(product).serializable_hash, status: :created
    else
      # ...
    end
  end

  def update
    if @product.update(product_params)
      render json: ProductSerializer.new(@product).serializable_hash
    else
      # ...
    end
  end
  # ...
end
----

And we're updating our functional test:

[source,ruby]
.test/controllers/api/v1/products_controller_test.rb
----
# ...
class Api::V1::ProductsControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  # ...
  test 'should show product' do
    # ...
    assert_equal @product.title, json_response['data']['attributes']['title']
  end
  # ...
end
----

You can check that tests pass but they should. Let's _commit_ these small changes:

[source, bash]
----
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Adds product serializer for custom json output"
----

=== Serialize associations

We have worked with serializers and you may notice that it is very simple. In some cases difficult decision is naming your routes or structuring the JSON output. When working with associations between models on an API there are many approaches you can take.

We don't have to worry about this problem in our case: JSON:API specifications did it for us!

To summarize we have a `has_many` type association between users and products.

[source,ruby]
.app/models/user.rb
----
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :products, dependent: :destroy
  # ...
end
----

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  # ...
end
----

It is a good idea to integrate users into the JSON outputs of products. This will make the output more cumbersome but it will prevent the API client from executing other requests to retrieve user information related to the products. This method can really save you a huge bottleneck.

== Theory of the injection of relationships

Imagine a scenario where you go to the API to get the products, but in this case you have to display some of the user information.

One possible solution would be adding the attribute `user_id` to the `product_serializer` so that we can get the corresponding user later. This may sound like a good idea, but if you are concerned about performance, or if your database transactions are not fast enough, you should reconsider this approach. You must understand that for each product you retrieve, you will have to retrieve its corresponding user.

Faced with this problem, there are several alternatives.

=== Integrate into a meta attribute

The first solution (a good one in my opinion) is to integrate identifiers of linkded users to products in a meta attribute. So we obtain a JSON like bellow:

[source,json]
----
{
  "meta": { "user_ids": [1,2,3] },
  "data": [

  ]
}
----

So that the client can retrieve these users from these `user_ids`.

=== Incorporate the object into the attribute

Another solution is to incorporate the `user` object into the `product` object. This may make the first request a little slower but in this way the client does not need to make another additional request. An example of the expected results is presented below:

[source,json]
----
{
  "data":
  [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "type": "product",
        "attributes": {
          "title": "First product",
          "price": "25.02",
          "published": false,
          "user": {
            "id": 2,
            "attributes": {
              "email": "stephany@lind.co.uk",
              "created_at": "2014-07-29T03:52:07.432Z",
              "updated_at": "2014-07-29T03:52:07.432Z",
              "auth_token": "Xbnzbf3YkquUrF_1bNkZ"
            }
          }
        }
    }
  ]
}
----

The problem with this approach is we have to duplicate the `User' objects for each product that belong to the same user:

[source,json]
----
{
  "data":
  [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "type": "product",
        "attributes": {
          "title": "First product",
          "price": "25.02",
          "published": false,
          "user": {
            "id": 2,
            "type": "user",
            "attributes": {
              "email": "stephany@lind.co.uk",
              "created_at": "2014-07-29T03:52:07.432Z",
              "updated_at": "2014-07-29T03:52:07.432Z",
              "auth_token": "Xbnzbf3YkquUrF_1bNkZ"
            }
          }
        }
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "type": "product",
        "attributes": {
          "title": "Second product",
          "price": "25.02",
          "published": false,
          "user": {
            "id": 2,
            "type": "user",
            "attributes": {
              "email": "stephany@lind.co.uk",
              "created_at": "2014-07-29T03:52:07.432Z",
              "updated_at": "2014-07-29T03:52:07.432Z",
              "auth_token": "Xbnzbf3YkquUrF_1bNkZ"
            }
          }
        }
    }
  ]
}
----


=== Incorporate the relationships into `include

The third solution (chosen by the JSON:API) is a mixture of the first two.

We will include all the relationships in an `include` key that will contain all the relationships of the previously mentioned objects. Also, each object will include a relationship key that defines the relationship and that must be found in the include key.

A JSON is worth a thousand words:

[source,json]
----
{
  "data":
  [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "type": "product",
        "attributes": {
          "title": "First product",
          "price": "25.02",
          "published": false
        },
        "relationships": {
          "user": {
            "id": 1,
            "type": "user"
          }
        }
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "type": "product",
        "attributes": {
          "title": "Second product",
          "price": "25.02",
          "published": false
        },
        "relationships": {
          "user": {
            "id": 1,
            "type": "user"
          }
        }
    }
  ],
  "include": [
    {
      "id": 2,
      "type": "user",
      "attributes": {
        "email": "stephany@lind.co.uk",
        "created_at": "2014-07-29T03:52:07.432Z",
        "updated_at": "2014-07-29T03:52:07.432Z",
        "auth_token": "Xbnzbf3YkquUrF_1bNkZ"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

Do you see the difference? This solution drastically reduces the size of the JSON and therefore the bandwidth used.

== Application of the injection of relationships

So we will incorporate the user object into the product. Let's start by adding some tests.

We will simply modify the `Products#show` test to verify that we are recovering:


[source,ruby]
.test/controllers/api/v1/products_controller_test.rb
----
# ...
class Api::V1::ProductsControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  # ...
  test 'should show product' do
    get api_v1_product_url(@product), as: :json
    assert_response :success

    json_response = JSON.parse(response.body, symbolize_names: true)
    assert_equal @product.title, json_response.dig(:data, :attributes, :title)
    assert_equal @product.user.id.to_s, json_response.dig(:data, :relationships, :user, :data, :id)
    assert_equal @product.user.email, json_response.dig(:included, 0, :attributes, :email)
  end
  # ...
end
----

We are now checking three things on the JSON that has been returned:

. it contains the title of the product
. it contains the user ID of the user linked to the product
. the user data is included in the `include` key

NOTE: You may have noticed that I have chosen to use the method https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Hash.html#method-i-dig[`Hash#dig`]. It is a Ruby method allowing you to retrieve elements in an nested _Hash_ by avoiding errors if an element is not present.

To pass this test we will start by including the relationship in the _serializer_:

[source,ruby]
.app/serializers/product_serializer.rb
----
class ProductSerializer
  include FastJsonapi::ObjectSerializer
  attributes :title, :price, :published
  belongs_to :user
end
----

This addition will add a `relationship` key containing the user's identifier:

[source,json]
----
{
  "data": {
      "id": "1",
      "type": "product",
      "attributes": {
          "title": "Durable Marble Lamp",
          "price": "11.55",
          "published": true
      },
      "relationships": {
          "user": {
              "data": {
                  "id": "1",
                  "type": "user"
              }
          }
      }
  }
}
----

This allows us correcting our first two assertions. We now want to include attributes of the user who owns the product. To do this we simply need to pass an option `:include` to the _serializer_ instantiated in the _controller_. Then let's do it:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/api/v1/products_controller.rb
----
class Api::V1::ProductsController < ApplicationController
  # ...
  def show
    options = { include: [:user] }
    render json: ProductSerializer.new(@product, options).serializable_hash
  end
  # ...
end
----

There you go. Now this is what the JSON should look like:

[source,json]
----
{
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "included": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "type": "user",
      "attributes": {
          "email": "staceeschultz@hahn.info"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

Now all tests should pass:

[source,bash]
----
$ rake test
........................
----

Let's make a _commit_ to celebrate:

[source,bash]
----
$ git commit -am "Add user relationship to product serializer"
----

<<<

=== Retrieve user's products

Do you understand the principle? We have included user information in the JSON of the products. We can do the same by including product information related to a user for the `/api/v1/users/1` page.

Let's start with the test:

[source,ruby]
.test/controllers/api/v1/users_controller_test.rb
----
# ...
class Api::V1::UsersControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  # ...
  test "should show user" do
    get api_v1_user_url(@user), as: :json
    assert_response :success

    json_response = JSON.parse(self.response.body, symbolize_names: true)
    assert_equal @user.email, json_response.dig(:data, :attributes, :email)
    assert_equal @user.products.first.id.to_s, json_response.dig(:data, :relationships, :products, :data, 0, :id)
    assert_equal @user.products.first.title, json_response.dig(:included, 0, :attributes, :title)
  end
  # ...
end
----

_serializer_:

[source,ruby]
.app/serializers/user_serializer.rb
----
class UserSerializer
  include FastJsonapi::ObjectSerializer
  attributes :email
  has_many :products
end
----

And to finish controller:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/api/v1/users_controller.rb
----
class Api::V1::UsersController < ApplicationController
  # ...
  def show
    options = { include: [:products] }
    render json: UserSerializer.new(@user, options).serializable_hash
  end
  # ...
end
----

There you go. We obtain a JSON like following:

[source,json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "id": "1",
    "type": "user",
    "attributes": {
      "email": "staceeschultz@hahn.info"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "products": {
        "data": [
          { "id": "1", "type": "product" },
          { "id": "2", "type": "product" }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "included": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "type": "product",
      "attributes": {
        "title": "Durable Marble Lamp",
        "price": "11.5537474980286",
        "published": true
      },
      "relationships": {
        "user": {
          "data": {
            "id": "1",
            "type": "user"
          }
        }
      }
    },
    {
        ...
    }
  ]
}
----

It was really easy. Let's make a _commit_:

[source,bash]
----
$ git commit -am "Add products relationship to user#show"
----

== Search for products

In this last section we will continue to strengthen the `Products#index` action by setting up a very simple search mechanism allowing any customer to filter the results. This section is optional as it will have no impact on the application modules. But if you want to practice more with the TDD I recommend that you to complete this last step.

I use https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack[Ransack] or https://github.com/casecommons/pg_search[pg_search] to build advanced search forms extremely quickly. But since the goal is learning and searching we are going to do is very simple. I think we can build a search engine from scratch. We simply have to consider the criteria by which we will filter the attributes. Hang on to your seats it's going to be a tough trip.

We will therefore filter the products according to the following criteria:

* By title
* By price
* Sort by creation date

It may seem short and easy, but believe me, it will give you a headache if you don't plan it.

=== The keyword by

We will create a _scope_ to find records that match a particular character pattern. Let's call it `filter_by_title`.

We will start by adding some _fixtures_ with different products to test:

[source,yaml]
.test/fixtures/products.yml
----
one:
  title: TV Plosmo Philopps
  price: 9999.99
  published: false
  user: one

two:
  title: Azos Zeenbok
  price: 499.99
  published: false
  user: two

another_tv:
  title: Cheap TV
  price: 99.99
  published: false
  user: two
----

And now we can build some tests:

[source,ruby]
.test/models/product_test.rb
----
# ...
class ProductTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  # ...
  test "should filter products by name" do
    assert_equal 2, Product.filter_by_title('tv').count
  end

  test 'should filter products by name and sort them' do
    assert_equal [products(:another_tv), products(:one)], Product.filter_by_title('tv').sort
  end
end
----

The following tests ensure that the method `Product.filter_by_title` will correctly search for products according to their title. We use the term `tv` in lowercase to ensure that our search will not be case sensitive.

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  # ...
  scope :filter_by_title, lambda { |keyword|
    where('lower(title) LIKE ?', "%#{keyword.downcase}%")
  }
end
----

NOTE: _scoping_ allows you to specify commonly used queries that can be referenced as method calls on models. With these __scopes__ you can also link with Active Record methods like `where`, `joins` and `includes` because a _scope_ always returns an object https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Relation.html[`ActiveRecord::Relation`]. I invite you taking a look at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#scopes_record_querying.html#scopes[Rails documentation]

Implementation is sufficient for our tests to pass:

[source,bash]
----
$ rake test
..........................
----

=== By price

To filter by price, things can get a little more delicate. We will break the logic of filtering by price in two different methods: one that will look for products larger than the price received and the other that will look for those that are below that price. This way, we will keep some flexibility and we can easily test the _scope_.

Let's start by building the tests of the _scope_ `above_or_equal_to_price`:

[source,ruby]
.test/models/product_test.rb
----
# ...
class ProductTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  # ...
  test 'should filter products by price and sort them' do
    assert_equal [products(:two), products(:one)], Product.above_or_equal_to_price(200).sort
  end
end
----

Implementation is very, very simple:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  # ...
  scope :above_or_equal_to_price, lambda { |price|
    where('price >= ?', price)
  }
end
----

This is sufficient to convert our tests to green:

[source,bash]
----
$ rake test

You can now imagine the behaviour of the opposite method. Here are the tests:

[source,ruby]
.test/models/product_test.rb
----
# ...
class ProductTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  # ...
  test 'should filter products by price lower and sort them' do
    assert_equal [products(:another_tv)], Product.below_or_equal_to_price(200).sort
  end
end
----

and the implementation.

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  # ...
  scope :below_or_equal_to_price, lambda { |price|
    where('price <= ?', price)
  }
end
----

For our sake, let's do the tests and check that everything is beautiful and green:

[source,bash]
----
$ rake test
............................
----

As you can see, we haven't had many problems. Let's just add another _scope_ to sort the records by date of last update. In the case where the owner of the products decides to update some data he will surely want to sort his products by creation date.

=== Sort by creation date

This _scope_ is very easy. Let's add some tests first:

[source,ruby]
.test/models/product_test.rb
----
# ...
class ProductTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  # ...
  test 'should sort product by most recent' do
    # we will touch some products to update them
    products(:two).touch
    products(:one)

    assert_equal [products(:another_tv), products(:one), products(:two)], Product.recent.to_a
  end
end
----

And the implementation:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  # ...
  scope :recent, lambda {
    order(:updated_at)
  }
end
----

All our tests should pass:

[source,bash]
----
$ rake test
.............................
----

Let's commit our changes:

[source,bash]
----
$ git commit -am "Adds search scopes on the product model"
----


==== Search engine

Now that we have the basis for the search engine we will use in the application, it is time to implement a simple but powerful search method. It will manage all the logic to retrieve the product records.

The method will consist in linking all the `scope` that we have previously built and returning the result. Let's start by adding some tests:

[source,ruby]
.test/models/product_test.rb
----
# ...
class ProductTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  # ...
  test 'search should not find "videogame" and "100" as min price' do
    search_hash = { keyword: 'videogame', min_price: 100 }
    assert Product.search(search_hash).empty?
  end

  test 'search should find cheap TV' do
    search_hash = { keyword: 'tv', min_price: 50, max_price: 150 }
    assert_equal [products(:another_tv)], Product.search(search_hash)
  end

  test 'should get all products when no parameters' do
    assert_equal Product.all.to_a, Product.search({})
  end

  test 'search should filter by product ids' do
    search_hash = { product_ids: [products(:one).id] }
    assert_equal [products(:one)], Product.search(search_hash)
  end
end
----

We have added a lot of code but I assure you that the implementation is very easy. You can go further and add some additional tests but, in my case, I didn't find it necessary.

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  # ...
  def self.search(params = {})
    products = params[:product_ids].present? ? Product.where(id: params[:product_ids]) : Product.all

    products = products.filter_by_title(params[:keyword]) if params[:keyword]
    products = products.above_or_equal_to_price(params[:min_price].to_f) if params[:min_price]
    products = products.below_or_equal_to_price(params[:max_price].to_f) if params[:max_price]
    products = products.recent if params[:recent]

    products
  end
end
----

It is important to note that we return the products as an object https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Relation.html[`ActiveRecord::Relation`] so that we can chain other methods if necessary or page them as we will see in the last chapters. Simply update the `Product#index` action to retrieve the products from the search method:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/api/v1/products_controller.rb
----
class Api::V1::ProductsController < ApplicationController
  # ...
  def index
    @products = Product.search(params)
    render json: ProductSerializer.new(@products).serializable_hash
  end
  # ...
end
----

We can run the entire test suite to ensure that the application is in good health so far:

[source,bash]
----
$ rake test
.................................
33 runs, 49 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
----

Let's commit all these changes:

[source,bash]
----
$ git commit -am "Adds search class method to filter products"
----

And as we get to the end of our chapter, it is time to apply all our modifications to the master branch by making a `merge`:

[source,bash]
----
$ git checkout master
$ git merge chapter06
----

== Conclusion

Until now it was easy thanks to the gem https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi_jsonapi[fast_jsonapi]. In the coming chapters we will start building the `Order` model that will involve users in the products.
